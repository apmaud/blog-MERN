This is one of the projects I have built for my personal learning of full-stack development.
The application is very simple to use, to start, a MongoDB database is needed. A free one can be created through MongoDB Atlas.
Connect the MongoDB database by adding the connection key in api/index.js inside mongoose.connect()
